# What is it?
Egl stands for Elegant Gothic Lolita. It is a subculture from Japan that is highly influenced by Victorian and Rococo period clothing. It originally started around the end of 1970s as a way for Japanese women to oppose their role in the society. So, lolita originally was a feminist statement and to this day it still is. The thing that makes many lolitas empowered is how the fashion embrasses femininity without being sexualised.

  # About the outfits
  Lolita outfit is a walking piece of art. Every detail is usually thought out, from materials to possible print motifs to color scheme. The complite outfit is called coord (short from coordination). Some lolitas do make their dresses by themselves, but there are good amount of dresses made by corporates.
  
  A coordinate usually contains several parts. A main piece which can be skirt, jumperskirt(JSK) which is a dress without sleeves or onepiece (OP) which is a dress with sleeves. A blouse, which goes under JSK or skirt (can also be used with short sleeved OPs). A petticoat, which gives the dress its shape. Socks, can be under or over the knees(UTKs and OTKs) or tights. Shoes, usually tea party shoes, oxfords or boots, but anything comfortable or suitable for weather is fine. A headpiece, can be a headbow, beret, hat or a flower crown, as long as it compliments the main piece. Finally accessories that can be necklaces, rings, earrings, bracelets, belts, corset, bags, parasols or brooches.

Lolita fashion is usually divided in the main three substyles which all have their own main brands and style features. Sweet lolita is worldwide most popular substyle. It focuses on wide variety of colors from soft pastel to navy blue and black. Sweet lolita dresses are often printed dresses and those print can contain small, cute animals, flowers, candy or pastries. The main brands for sweet lolitas are Angelic Pretty ([AP Paris](https://angelicpretty-paris.com/gb/)) and Baby, the Stars Shine Brightly([BtSSB](https://babyssb.shop/)).

  Second major substyle is classic lolita. This substyle embrasses more muted colors, like browns, creams, blues, greens and blacks. There are some printed dresses but good part of classic lolita pieces are plain. The brands carrying mostly classic are Innocent World([IW](https://innocent-w.jp/onlineshop/en/)), Victorian maiden and Mary Magdalene. There is also Metamorphose Temps de Fille([Metamorphose](https://metamorphose.gr.jp/en/online-shop)) which has a variety of different type of dresses, not only classic.

The third and final substyle is gothic lolita. As the name suggest its aesthetic is darker than the previous ones. While black is the most used color, white, wine and navy are also quite popular. Print motifs often seen are fences, crosses, gravestones, roses and skulls. The biggest brand is Moi-même-Moitié([MMM](https://www.wunderwelt.jp/en/collections/moi-meme-moitie)) but Atelier Pierrot([AtePie](https://atelier-pierrot.shop-pro.jp/)) also has gain popularity.

Obviously there are countless other brands and retailers as well as substyles out there. Chinese indie brands have gain some foothold as they often offer cheaper prizes and custom sizing which mainstream brands don't have. Except for Metamorphose which is actually offering plus size pieces.
  
# EGL community, Glitter Mafia2.0
Community is a big part of lolita fashion. Sharing coord pictures, finding inspiration and having meetups is what make lolita so lively. There are even events that revolves mainly around EGL fashion and those events usually contain fashion shows, conversation panels, shopping and tea parties. Tea parties have become very much a staple event for lolitas and they often put together most extravagant coords for those gatherings.

However, it is not a requirement for attending. Lolita is an expensive hobby, even more if one is lifestyle lolita AKA someone who use lolita daily and decorate their house and eventually whole life fitting the aesthetic. Most communities are very open for lolitas with more limited wardrobes, like newbies and casual hobbyists.

A lolita community might be bit rough on you if you show up constantly without wearing the fashion and that is because of the harassment they experience. Not only do some people think that lolita is some fetish or a version of age-play there is the name issue. *Lolita* the book by Nabokov seem to be the first thing that come in mind when someone mentions lolita. The book if someone is unfamiliar with it is a story about a pedophile grooming and later assaulting a young girl and it has **NOTHING** to do with the fashion. Not to mention certain parts of BDSM community have in the past stolen pictures of lolitas and reused them in their fantasies and/or plays, which is against the rules of consent in BDSM. That is the reason term EGL is largely used now days. And the reason why sometimes it may seem like there is ridiculous amount of rules and gate keeping in lolita communities. They simply want to make sure that their members, who might be asexuals or minors, are safe. 

Community can be great asset also on growing your wardrobe. A lot of pieces go to one coord and getting everything from a retailer would be expensive, so EGL community has a booming second-hand market. Often local communities hold swap meets where one can find pieces cheap and it is a great way to see what you are buying in real life. There is also a worldwide second-hand selling site known as [LaceMarket](https://egl.circlly.com/). It is like Ebay but for EGL clothing and merchandise.

# Meeting in real life
Lolita is not a silent fashion. It's loud and different and people do love to stare. I have gathered some helpful tips that can be used whenever you see a person wearing alternative fashion, like gothic, punk, fairy kei or EGL.
